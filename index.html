            I am Tristan Lacombe, a 3<sup>rd</sup> year PhD student at
            Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans in Clermont-Ferrand (France) working
            on volcanism. Except volcanoes my main interests goes towards
            Science Communication in diverse fields as Earth and Planetary
            science or Astronomy. Since the beginning of my PhD I feel also more
            and more attracted by code and I enjoy learning different languages
            on my free time.

            My PhD thesis is about basaltic and phonolitic volcanism of Petite
            terre, a small island near the island of Mayotte (Comoros, Western
            Indian Ocean). Following the discovery of an active submarine
            volcano 50 km east of Mayotte in 2018 the idea that volcanic
            activity in Mayotte was not extinct grew stronger as evidence from
            magmatic CO2 degassing and existence of presumably young volcanism
            were already known. These evidences of active volcanism focus on the
            small island of Petite Terre located in the lagoon around Mayotte
            main island Grande Terre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Petite Terre itself is composed by the volcanic products of the 4
            maars (crater leaved by a specific type of volcanic explosive
            activity, think about Pompeii eruption) covering several scoria
            cones (formed by much less explosive activity with lava flows as
            Kilauea or Piton de la Fournaise). Though the explosive activity
            seems rather young it precise age remains unknown as well as it
            eruption style since the volcanism in the area is very poorly
            studied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my PhD I'm working on deciphering the precise sequence of
            events during these eruptions. To do so, I use both volcanology,
            petrology and geochemistry to probe not only <b>HOW</b> the eruption
            happen but also <b>WHY</b> the eruption happen. These data, will be
            used later by other scientists to understand these very peculiar
            volcanoes and the authorities to create evacuation models in case of
            volcanic unrest in the area.
